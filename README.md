### Website description ###

* Upon entering the site, users select a nickname.  After a nickname has been selected, they enter the lobby containing all the existing rooms.  Users can join rooms by clicking on them, or create their own room.  Once inside a room, users can see all the other users in the same room, and send private/public messages.  Only the creator of the room and the moderators have the power to kick/ban normal users.  Users can leave or join rooms as they please, as long as they are not permanently banned.


### Creative Portion Description ###

* Filter for bad words:  Users can check/uncheck the filter button to filter/unfilter bad words.  By default, the list of bad words contains only "dumb" and "fool".  Users have the option to add additional words that they want to filter.
* Color coding: Public messages are displayed as blue, while private messages are red.  We also color coded the list of users currently in the room, based on their status (admin, moderator, or a normal user).
* Adding moderators: The creator of the chat room has the option of making other users moderators of that room.  The moderators can kick/ban users, but they cannot make other users moderators (only the creator of the room can add moderators).

### Who do I talk to? ###

* Zach Miller (457758) or David Qiu (437405)
